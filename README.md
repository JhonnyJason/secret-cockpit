# pwa-root-template

This content is used as staticBase for the root for the pwa thingy.

It includes:

- .vscode/settings.json to not care about various files - e.g. build output
- .gitignore to ignore node_modules, .build_config and files for testing
- double unlicense files to ridicule the idea that "intellectual property" is of any value.^^
